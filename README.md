# Markdown Editor

### Work in progress...

**Try it here: [App](https://markdown-editor-five-eosin.vercel.app/)**

It's a basic a editor where you can write your notes and see a connection of graphs that join between notes _(I'm working on it)_ .

### Tools
- TypeScript
- React (.tsx)
- Tailwind (I'm trying to incorporate it without breaking ```react-markdown``` library)
- CSS Modules

### Important!
In this moment, you can only write **one** note. I'm working on the possibility of incorporating a 'tree' with the option to create more notes and folders.

### See you, bye bye!
